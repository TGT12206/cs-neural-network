# cs-neural-network
My system for neural networks that use backpropagation, written in C#

The zip file is a much older version. I realized I probably shouldn't be using lists for everything, the neuron class is redundant, and the variable names were bad. The newest code (as of 10/4/2023) is "MachineLearning.cs", and I wrote some code to test it in "xorModel". It trains a fully connected neural network to approximate the xor gate. Keep in mind that it doesn't successfully learn it every single time. (could also be a result of some bug I haven't found)
